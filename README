Count Leading Zeroes:
    Converts the 32-bit decimal number to binary and counts the number of zeroes before a '1'.
    
Endian Swap:
    Swaps bytes 0 and 3, along with bytes 1 and 2.
    
Rotate:
    Takes an extra integer operand. This decides by how many bits the first integer is rotated by.
    
Parity:
    Outputs a '0' if even parity (number of 1's in binary representation of decimal number is even), or a '1' if parity is odd.

Compile:
    gcc *.c
    
Execution:
    ./a.out
